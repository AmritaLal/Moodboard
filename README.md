# Moodboard
By using DaVinci, I wanted to communicate a message associated with a sound for a school project. Starting from the sound suggestion, I created a moodboard and then I added the visual  suggestion of the narrative evoked by the sound. After that I made a short video. The moodboard constitutes the visual communication of the next short film, with the rendering of the atmosphere and the color palette.  The delivery format is an HTML5 file.
